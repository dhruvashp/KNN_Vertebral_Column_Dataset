HW1 f

The lowest training error was obtained as:
    
0;when k was fixed at 1 (obviously, trivial)

0;when weights were used in line with vector distance from a point

0.13333;when no weights were used and we considered k>1 (again obviously) this was the lowest
that the training error got across multiple methods
