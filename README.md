# KNN_Vertebral_Column_Dataset

This set of code is to perform KNN on a Vertebral Column Dataset, as part of a project assignment done for DSCI 552, Machine Learning for Data Sciences, taken in Fall 2020, taught by Prof. Rajati

The coding was done in Fall 2020, however an organized commit in GitHub was done later (around Spring 2021), since I realized my original commits were in a private repository created specifically for this course

As is evident from the title of the repository, KNN with various variants and variations was performed on the above dataset.
